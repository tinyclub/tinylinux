# This is a param list which has already been enabled by kernel, as a regular
# user, please don't touch this but config CONFIG_PARAM_LIST instead.

# For the kernel maintainer, whenever you want to add a new param here, please
# remember to add it via:
# 	$ scripts/setup_param.sh param_name
# Or if you want to remove one default param:
# 	$ scripts/unsetup_param.sh param_name
#
# If you want to do them automatically, you can config CONFIG_PARAM_LIST at
# first, then, checkin the change and copy your config to this file.
#
# Note: To {un}setup an {un}setup param will be very slow, so, please don't try
# to do that ;-)
